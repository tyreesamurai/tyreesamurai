# 👋 Hi, I’m Tyree Carpenter

I’m a **Computer Science graduate** from **Virginia Commonwealth University** with a concentration in **Software Engineering**, focused on building **clean, scalable, real-world applications**.
I’m rebuilding my GitHub to reflect the kind of work I care about today: well-designed full-stack systems, thoughtful APIs, and projects that feel complete—not just demos.

## What I focus on

- Full-stack application development
- Backend systems & API design
- Real-world project structure, testing, and deployment
- Learning by building end-to-end products

One project that shaped this mindset was serving as **lead developer** on the **VCU School of Nursing clinician tablet prototype**—a React Native app used to summarize patient survey data for clinicians. That experience showed me how impactful software can be when it’s built around real users and real constraints.

📬 I’m currently open to **full-stack software engineering roles** and open to **relocation**.  
Thanks for stopping by.

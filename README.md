# 👋 Hi, I'm Tyree Carpenter

I recently graduated from **Virginia Commonwealth University** with a **B.S. in Computer Science** & a concentration in **Software Engineering**. I'm restarting my GitHub from scratch to focus on building meaningful, real-world projects that reflect my current interests & goals.

The class projects I previously uploaded were helpful for learning but didn't represent the kind of full-stack, scalable, & impactful applications I aim to build today. This new phase is all about:

- 🌍 Showcasing complete, well-documented apps
- 🧠 Exploring modern web, backend, and infrastructure technologies
- 🚀 Building a portfolio that demonstrates job-ready skills
